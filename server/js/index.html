          <h2>How Object Detection Works</h2>
        </div>
        <ul>
        <p>Object detection is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. It typically consists of two main steps:</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features from the input image, such as edges, shapes, or textures.</li>
          <li>Object Classification and Localization: Using machine learning models to classify objects and determine their locations within the image.</li>
        <p>This technology is widely used in various applications, including surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and more.</p>

        <h2>History of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine learning has a rich history dating back to the mid-20th century. Some key milestones in its development include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1950s: The beginnings of neural networks and the development of early machine learning algorithms.</li>
          <li>1980s-1990s: Advancements in supervised learning and the emergence of support vector machines.</li>
          <li>2000s-Present: The rise of deep learning, neural networks with multiple hidden layers, and breakthroughs in various machine learning fields.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Machine learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and has enabled remarkable applications in various industries.</p>
